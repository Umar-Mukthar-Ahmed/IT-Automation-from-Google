Question 5
In the lab’ script, what is the purpose of the if __name__ == "__main__": block, and why is it important for the execution of the script?

1 point

The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to display an error message to the user if any errors are encountered during script execution.


The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to define custom functions for the script, and it doesn't impact the script's execution.


The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to specify the author's name and copyright information for the script.


The if __name__ == "__main__": block is the main entry point of the script, where the script's execution begins when it is run as the main program.

Question 6
You are analyzing a log file. What would happen if you didn’t escape special characters in your regular expression? 

1 point

There would be no effect.


The regular expression would match the literal character instead of the special meaning.


The script would not run.


The regular expression would not match anything.

7.
Question 7
In the script's execution process described, what are the main functions called, and in what order?

1 point

error_output() and file_output() called in that order


file_search() and error_search() called in that order


error_search() and file_output() called in that order 


file_output() and error_search()called in that order

Question 8
How does the find_error.py script process the fishy.log file according to the provided content?

1 point

It compresses fishy.log to reduce its size for storage efficiency.


It automatically detects and fixes syntax errors within fishy.log.


The script first searches fishy.log for user-specified errors and then generates a new file, errors_found.log, containing these errors.


The script translates the contents of fishy.log into another programming language for cross-platform compatibility.

Question 9
What is the primary function of the os module in Python?

1 point

The os module is used exclusively for web development purposes.


For managing and manipulating file paths and directory structures


To handle machine learning algorithms and data analysis


It provides functions for creating and managing graphical interfaces.

Question 10
Apply what you’ve learned from this lab to answer this question. You are working on the find_error.py script to search for specific errors in the fishy.log file. If you need to find all instances of a network connection failure, which of the following steps would you take to modify the script accordingly?

1 point

Edit the file_output function to filter out all logs except those containing the word "network".


Change the error_patterns list to include only "network" and "failure", and then run the script with fishy.log.


Modify the user input line to specifically ask for "network connection failure" errors, then process fishy.log.


Rewrite the Regular Expression in the script to only match logs with the word "network".
